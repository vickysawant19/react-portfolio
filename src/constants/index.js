  summary: `Full Stack Web Developer with expertise in React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and JavaScript. 
Currently interning as a Jr. Front-end Developer Intern at AUROSKKIL, where I am honing my front-end skills through intensive training and hands-on projects. Previously, during my internship at Synexoo, I developed a Learning Management System (LMS) using the MERN stack, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS to deliver secure and efficient user experiences.
With 6+ years of experience teaching electronics and web development, I bring a strong foundation in embedded systems, programming, and circuit design. I have also completed a Data Science course, gaining proficiency in Python, SQL, and Machine Learning, which enhances my problem-solving and analytical abilities.`,

export const ABOUT = `I am a dedicated Electronics Engineer with a strong background in teaching and a passion for integrating emerging technologies such as AI and IoT. With 6 years of experience in electronics, IoT, and programming, I've transitioned into web development and expanded my expertise through a Data Science course. I have developed a range of projectsâ€”from web applications and real-time communication platforms to innovative solutions that merge AI capabilities with IoT sensor data.

My work includes an AI Recipe Generator that leverages the Gemini AI API to generate personalized recipes, and an IoT & AI Based Smart Farm Control system that reads sensor data using ESP8266, processes it with an Express.js backend, and displays the data on a React and Vite-powered frontend with secure user authentication managed by Appwrite. These experiences empower me to design and deliver robust, scalable solutions that drive technological innovation.`;
